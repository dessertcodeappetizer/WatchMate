I have developed an IMDb API Clone where a user can make its own ID, rate a video content
either by commenting his feedback or by giving stars. User can perform CRUD operations
with his ratings and can also read the ratings of other users. I have also done API testing
(manually and automated) using PostMan and PyTest.
